## Status
- Currently dogfooding.
- Major bugs have been addressed.
- Frequent breaking changes.
- Memo
  - Initially, we attempted implementation with GitHub Actions, but it proved unsuitable for PR monitoring, so we transitioned to a Python version.
  - The Python version monitors user-owned repositories for authenticated GitHub users and performs notifications and actions based on the PR's phase.

## Overview

This Python tool monitors the phases of Pull Requests where GitHub Copilot performs automated implementations and executes appropriate notifications and actions at the right time.
It targets user-owned repositories of authenticated GitHub users and efficiently monitors PRs using the GraphQL API.

## Features

- **Automated monitoring of all repositories**: Automatically monitors PRs in user-owned repositories for authenticated GitHub users.
- **GraphQL API utilization**: Achieves high-speed monitoring through efficient data retrieval.
- **Phase detection**: Automatically determines the PR state (phase1: Draft, phase2: Addressing review comments, phase3: Waiting for review, LLM working: Coding agent in progress).
- **Dry-run mode**: By default, only monitoring is performed, and actual actions (comment posting, marking PR as Ready, sending notifications) are not executed. Can be safely operated by explicit activation.
- **Automatic comment posting**: Automatically posts appropriate comments based on the phase (requires activation in the configuration file).
- **Multi-agent support**: If the PR author is `openai-code-agent` or similar `*-codex-coding-agent` types, it automatically mentions `@codex[agent]`. If it's `anthropic-code-agent` or similar `*-claude-coding-agent` types, it mentions `@claude[agent]`. Otherwise, it falls back to `@copilot` (can be overridden by `[coding_agent].agent_name`; `@copilot` if unset).
- **Automatic Draft PR readiness**: Automatically changes Draft PRs to a Ready state to address review comments in phase2 (requires activation in the configuration file).
- **Mobile notifications**: Uses ntfy.sh to notify mobile devices when phase3 (waiting for review) is detected (requires activation in the configuration file).
  - Notifies when an individual PR enters phase3.
  - Notifies when all PRs enter phase3 (message configurable in TOML).
- **Issue list display**: If all PRs are in "LLM working" state, displays the top N issues (default: 10, changeable via `issue_display_limit`) for repositories without open PRs.
- **Self-update**: If `enable_auto_update = true` is set, detects updates in the GitHub repository every minute and automatically pulls and restarts if the working tree is clean and fast-forwardable (disabled by default).
- **Power-saving mode**: If no state changes occur, the monitoring interval is automatically extended to reduce API usage (`no_change_timeout` and `reduced_frequency_interval` configurable).
- **Verbose mode**: Displays detailed configuration information at startup and during execution to help detect configuration errors (enabled by `verbose`).

## Architecture

This tool is a modular Python application adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

```

### Phase Detection Logic

The tool detects the following four phases:

1.  **phase1 (Draft state)**: PR is in Draft state and has review requests.
2.  **phase2 (Addressing review comments)**: `copilot-pull-request-reviewer` has posted review comments, and corrections are needed.
3.  **phase3 (Waiting for review)**: `copilot-swe-agent` has completed corrections and is waiting for human review.
4.  **LLM working (Coding agent in progress)**: None of the above apply (e.g., Copilot is implementing).

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher is installed.
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) is installed and authenticated.
  ```bash
  gh auth login
  ```

### Setup

1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cat2151/cat-github-watcher.git
    cd cat-github-watcher
    ```

2.  Create a configuration file (optional):
    ```bash
    cp config.toml.example config.toml
    ```

3.  Edit `config.toml` to configure monitoring intervals, execution modes, ntfy.sh notifications, Copilot auto-assignment, and auto-merge (optional):
    ```toml
    # Check interval (e.g., "30s", "1m", "5m", "1h", "1d")
    interval = "1m"
    
    # Maximum number of issues to display from repositories without PRs
    # Default is 10, but can be changed to any positive number (e.g., 5, 15, 20)
    issue_display_limit = 10
    
    # Timeout period for no state change
    # If the state of all PRs (each PR's phase) does not change for this duration,
    # the monitoring interval will switch to power-saving mode (reduced_frequency_interval below).
    # Set to an empty string "" to disable.
    # Supported formats: "30s", "1m", "5m", "30m", "1h", "1d"
    # Default: "30m" (30 minutes - prioritizing stability)
    no_change_timeout = "30m"
    
    # Override the coding agent mention used in posted comments (defaults to @copilot if omitted)
    [coding_agent]
    agent_name = "@codex[agent]"
    
    # Monitoring interval in power-saving mode
    # If no state changes are detected during the no_change_timeout period,
    # the monitoring interval switches to this interval to reduce API usage.
    # It returns to the normal monitoring interval when a change is detected.
    # Supported formats: "30s", "1m", "5m", "30m", "1h", "1d"
    # Default: "1h" (1 hour)
    reduced_frequency_interval = "1h"
    
    # Verbose mode - displays detailed configuration information
    # If enabled, all settings will be displayed at startup, and repository-specific settings
    # will be displayed during execution.
    # Helps detect configuration errors.
    # Default: false
    verbose = false
    
    # Color scheme for terminal output
    # Can be "monokai" (default) or "classic"
    color_scheme = "monokai"
    
    # Individual color codes can be overridden in the [colors] section (#RRGGBB format / ANSI compatible)
    # If omitted, the palette from the above color_scheme will be used.
    [colors]

    # Execution control flags - can only be specified within the [[rulesets]] section
    # Global flags are no longer supported.
    # To apply settings to all repositories, use 'repositories = ["all"]'.
    
    # Example ruleset configuration:
    # [[rulesets]]
    # name = "Default for all repositories - dry-run mode"
    # repositories = ["all"]  # "all" matches all repositories
    # enable_execution_phase1_to_phase2 = false  # Set to true to mark draft PRs as ready
    # enable_execution_phase2_to_phase3 = false  # Set to true to post phase2 comments

    # repositories = ["my-repo"]
    # assign_good_first_old = true  # This alone is enough! The [assign_to_copilot] section is not needed.
    #                               # Default behavior: open issue in browser for manual assignment
    
    # ntfy.sh notification settings (optional)
    # Notifications include a clickable action button to open the PR.
    [ntfy]
    enabled = false  # Set to true to enable notifications
    topic = "<Enter your ntfy.sh topic name here>"  # Make it an unguessable string as anyone can read/write to it
    message = "PR is ready for review: {url}"  # Message template

    all_phase3_message = "All PRs are now in phase3 (ready for review)"  # Message when all PRs are in phase3
    
    # Phase3 auto-merge settings (optional)
    # Automatically merges the PR once it reaches phase3 (waiting for review).
    # Before merging, a comment defined below will be posted to the PR.
    # After successful merge, the feature branch will be automatically deleted.
    # IMPORTANT: For safety, this feature is disabled by default.
    # You must explicitly enable it by specifying enable_execution_phase3_to_merge = true in rulesets for each repository.
    # IMPORTANT: If auto-merge is enabled, the comment field must be explicitly set.
    [phase3_merge]
    comment = "The agent has determined that review comments have been addressed. User review is skipped under the user's responsibility. Merging the PR."  # Comment to post before merging (required when auto-merge is enabled)
    automated = false  # Set to true to automate browser operation to click the merge button
    wait_seconds = 10  # Wait time (seconds) after browser launch before clicking the button
    debug_dir = "debug_screenshots"  # Directory to save debug info on image recognition failure (default: "debug_screenshots")
    notification_enabled = true  # Display a small notification window at specified coordinates during automated button operation
    notification_message = "Opening browser and searching for Merge button..."  # Message for the notification window
    notification_width = 400
    notification_height = 150
    notification_position_x = 100
    notification_position_y = 100
    maximize_on_first_fail = true  # Maximize window and re-search if button not found on first attempt
    
    # Auto-assign issues to Copilot (completely optional! This entire section is optional)
    #
    # Simple usage: just set assign_good_first_old = true in rulesets (see example above).
    # Define this section ONLY if you want to customize the default behavior.
    #
    # Assignment behavior is controlled by ruleset flags:
    # - assign_ci_failure_old: Assigns the oldest "ci-failure" issue (by issue number, default: false)
    # - assign_deploy_pages_failure_old: Assigns the oldest "deploy-pages-failure" issue (by issue number, default: false)
    # - assign_good_first_old: Assigns the oldest "good first issue" (by issue number, default: false)
    # - assign_old: Assigns the oldest issue (by issue number, regardless of label, default: false)
    # Priority: ci-failure > deploy-pages-failure > good first issue > old issue
    #
    # Default behavior (if this section is not defined):
    # - Automatically clicks buttons using browser automation
    # - Uses PyAutoGUI for image recognition
    # - OCR fallback if image recognition fails (optional)
    # - wait_seconds = 10
    #
    # Required: PyAutoGUI must be installed (pip install pyautogui pillow)
    # Optional: pytesseract installation is required for OCR fallback
    #
    # IMPORTANT: For safety, this feature is disabled by default.
    # You must explicitly enable it by specifying assign_ci_failure_old / assign_deploy_pages_failure_old /
    # assign_good_first_old / assign_old in rulesets for each repository.
    [assign_to_copilot]
    wait_seconds = 10  # Wait time (seconds) after browser launch before clicking the button
    debug_dir = "debug_screenshots"  # Directory to save debug info on image recognition failure (default: "debug_screenshots")
    confidence = 0.8  # Image matching confidence 0.0-1.0 (default: 0.8)
    enable_ocr_detection = true  # Enable OCR fallback (default: true)
    notification_enabled = true  # Display a small notification window at specified coordinates during automated button operation
    notification_message = "Opening browser and searching for Copilot assignment button..."  # Message for the notification window
    notification_width = 400
    notification_height = 150
    notification_position_x = 100
    notification_position_y = 100
    maximize_on_first_fail = true  # Maximize window and re-search if button not found on first attempt
    # enable_html_detection = false  # HTML detection fallback (experimental, default: false)
    ```

4.  **Prepare Button Screenshots (only if using automation)**:

    If you are using automation features (`automated = true` or enabling `assign_to_copilot` / `phase3_merge`),
    PyAutoGUI requires screenshots of the buttons to click.

    **Required screenshots:**

    For automated issue assignment (`assign_to_copilot` feature):
    - `assign_to_copilot.png` - Screenshot of the "Assign to Copilot" button
    - `assign.png` - Screenshot of the "Assign" button

    For automated PR merging (`phase3_merge` feature with `automated = true`):
    - `merge_pull_request.png` - Screenshot of the "Merge pull request" button
    - `confirm_merge.png` - Screenshot of the "Confirm merge" button
    - `delete_branch.png` - Screenshot of the "Delete branch" button (optional)

    **How to take screenshots:**

    a. Open a GitHub issue or PR in your browser.
    b. Locate the button you want to automate.
    c. Take a screenshot of **only the button** (not the entire screen).
    d. Save it as a PNG file in the `screenshots` directory.
    e. Use the exact filenames listed above.

    **Tips:**
    - The screenshot should only include the button, with a small margin.
    - Use your OS's screenshot tool (Windows: Snipping Tool, Mac: Cmd+Shift+4).
    - Ensure the button is clearly visible and not obscured.
    - If the button's appearance changes (e.g., due to theme changes), you'll need to update the screenshots.
    - Use the `confidence` setting to adjust image recognition reliability (due to DPI scaling or themes).

    **Automatic saving of debug information:**
    - If image recognition fails, debug information is automatically saved.
    - Save location: `debug_screenshots/` directory (default).
    - Contents saved:
      - Screenshot (entire screen at time of failure): `{button_name}_fail_{timestamp}.png`
      - Candidate region screenshots (if found): `{button_name}_candidate_{timestamp}_{number}.png`
      - Failure info JSON: `{button_name}_fail_{timestamp}.json`
        - Button name, timestamp, confidence threshold, screenshot path, template image path.
        - Candidate region information (coordinates, size, confidence).
    - During debugging, up to 3 candidate regions are detected with lower confidence (0.7, 0.6, 0.5).
    - The debug directory can be changed in settings: `debug_dir` option (within `assign_to_copilot` or `phase3_merge` sections).

    **Fallback methods (if image recognition fails):**
    - **OCR detection (enabled by default)**: Uses pytesseract to detect button text.
      - Directly detects text like "Assign to Copilot" on the screen.
      - Robust against sub-pixel rendering differences.
      - Required: tesseract-ocr installation (system level).
      - Disable: `enable_ocr_detection = false`.

    **Important requirements:**
    - You must be **already logged into GitHub** in your default browser.
    - Automation uses existing browser sessions (it does not perform new authentication).
    - Ensure the correct GitHub window/tab is focused and visible on screen when a button click is expected.
    - If multiple GitHub pages are open, the first found button will be clicked.

    **Create the screenshots directory:**
    ```bash
    mkdir screenshots
    ```

5.  Install PyAutoGUI (only if using automation):

    For basic image recognition only:
    ```bash
    pip install pyautogui pillow pygetwindow
    ```

    Including OCR fallback (recommended):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements-automation.txt
    ```

    If using OCR, install tesseract-ocr system-wide:
    - **Windows**: `choco install tesseract`
    - **macOS**: `brew install tesseract`
    - **Linux**: `apt-get install tesseract-ocr`

### Execution

Start the tool to begin monitoring:

```bash
python3 cat-github-watcher.py [config.toml]
```

Or, run directly as a Python module:

```bash
python3 -m src.gh_pr_phase_monitor.main [config.toml]
```

### Workflow

1.  **Start**: When the tool starts, it begins monitoring user-owned repositories for the authenticated GitHub user.
2.  **PR Detection**: Automatically detects repositories with open PRs.
3.  **Phase Determination**: Determines the phase of each PR (phase1/2/3, LLM working).
4.  **Action Execution**:
    - **phase1**: Default is Dry-run (if `enable_execution_phase1_to_phase2 = true` in rulesets, marks Draft PR as Ready).
    - **phase2**: Default is Dry-run (if `enable_execution_phase2_to_phase3 = true` in rulesets, posts a comment requesting Copilot to apply changes).
    - **phase3**: Opens the PR page in the browser.
      - If `enable_execution_phase3_send_ntfy = true` in rulesets, also sends ntfy.sh notification.
      - If `enable_execution_phase3_to_merge = true` in rulesets, automatically merges the PR (uses global `[phase3_merge]` settings).
    - **LLM working**: Waits (if all PRs are in this state, displays issues from repositories without open PRs).
5.  **Automated Issue Assignment**: If all PRs are "LLM working" and there are repositories without open PRs:
    - If `assign_ci_failure_old = true` in rulesets, automatically assigns the oldest "ci-failure" issue (by issue number).
    - If `assign_deploy_pages_failure_old = true` in rulesets, automatically assigns the oldest "deploy-pages-failure" issue (by issue number).
    - If `assign_good_first_old = true` in rulesets, automatically assigns the oldest "good first issue" (by issue number).
    - If `assign_old = true` in rulesets, automatically assigns the oldest issue (by issue number, regardless of label).
    - Priority: ci-failure > deploy-pages-failure > good first issue > old issue.
    - Default behavior: Automatically clicks buttons with PyAutoGUI (the `[assign_to_copilot]` section is not needed).
    - Required: PyAutoGUI installation and preparation of button screenshots.
6.  **Repeat**: Continues monitoring at the configured interval.
    - If no state change occurs for the duration set by `no_change_timeout`, it automatically switches to power-saving mode (`reduced_frequency_interval`) to reduce API usage.
    - Returns to the normal monitoring interval when a change is detected.

### Dry-run Mode

By default, the tool operates in **Dry-run mode** and does not perform actual actions. This allows you to safely verify its operation.

-   **Phase1 (Draft → Ready)**: Displays `[DRY-RUN] Would mark PR as ready for review` but does nothing actually.
-   **Phase2 (Comment Posting)**: Displays `[DRY-RUN] Would post comment for phase2` but does nothing actually.
-   **Phase3 (ntfy Notification)**: Displays `[DRY-RUN] Would send ntfy notification` but does nothing actually.
-   **Phase3 (Merge)**: Displays `[DRY-RUN] Would merge PR` but does nothing actually.

To enable actual actions, set the following flags to `true` in the `[[rulesets]]` section of `config.toml`:
```toml
[[rulesets]]
name = "Enable automation for specific repository"
repositories = ["test-repo"]  # Or ["all"] for all repositories
enable_execution_phase1_to_phase2 = true  # Mark Draft PR as Ready
enable_execution_phase2_to_phase3 = true  # Post Phase2 comment
enable_execution_phase3_send_ntfy = true  # Send ntfy notification
enable_execution_phase3_to_merge = true   # Merge Phase3 PR
assign_ci_failure_old = true              # Auto-assign ci-failure issue
assign_deploy_pages_failure_old = true    # Auto-assign deploy-pages-failure issue
assign_good_first_old = true              # Auto-assign good first issue
```

### Stopping

You can stop monitoring by pressing `Ctrl+C`.

## Notes

- GitHub CLI (`gh`) must be installed and authenticated.
- This tool is designed to integrate with GitHub Copilot (specifically `copilot-pull-request-reviewer` and `copilot-swe-agent`).
- Only **user-owned repositories** of the authenticated user are monitored. Organization repositories are not included to keep the tool simple and focused (YAGNI principle).
- Be mindful of GraphQL API rate limits.
- If using ntfy.sh notifications, configure a topic on [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh/) in advance.

## Testing

The project includes a test suite using pytest:
