## Status
- Currently dogfooding.
- Major bugs have been addressed.
- Breaking changes occur frequently.
- Memo
  - Initially, implementation was attempted with GitHub Actions, but it was found unsuitable for PR monitoring, so we transitioned to a Python version.
  - The Python version monitors user-owned repositories of authenticated GitHub users and performs notifications and actions based on the PR phase.

## Overview

This Python tool monitors the phases of Pull Requests where GitHub Copilot performs automated implementation, and executes notifications and actions at appropriate timings.
It targets user-owned repositories of authenticated GitHub users and efficiently monitors PRs using the GraphQL API.

## Features

- **Automatic Monitoring of All Repositories**: Automatically monitors PRs in user-owned repositories of authenticated GitHub users.
- **Leveraging GraphQL API**: Achieves high-speed monitoring through efficient data retrieval.
- **Phase Detection**: Automatically determines the PR state (phase1: Draft status, phase2: Addressing review comments, phase3: Awaiting review, LLM working: Coding agent in progress).
- **Dry-run Mode**: By default, only monitoring is performed, and actual actions (comment posting, making PR Ready, sending notifications) are not executed. Can be safely operated by explicit enablement.
- **Automatic Comment Posting**: Automatically posts appropriate comments based on the phase (requires enablement in configuration file).
- **Multi-Agent Support**: Automatically mentions `@codex[agent]` if the PR author is an `openai-code-agent` or similar `*-codex-coding-agent` type, or `@claude[agent]` if an `anthropic-code-agent` or similar `*-claude-coding-agent` type. Falls back to `@copilot` otherwise (`[coding_agent].agent_name` can override, defaults to @copilot if not set).
- **Automatic Draft PR Readiness**: Automatically changes Draft PRs to Ready status for addressing review comments in phase2 (requires enablement in configuration file).
- **Mobile Notifications**: Uses ntfy.sh to notify mobile devices when phase3 (awaiting review) is detected (requires enablement in configuration file).
  - Notifies when an individual PR enters phase3.
  - Also notifies when all PRs enter phase3 (message configurable in TOML).
- **Issue List Display**: If all PRs are "LLM working", displays the top N issues (default: 10, configurable via `issue_display_limit`) for repositories without open PRs.
- **Power-saving Mode**: If no state change, automatically extends the monitoring interval to reduce API usage (`no_change_timeout` and `reduced_frequency_interval` are configurable).
- **Verbose Mode**: Displays detailed configuration information at startup and during execution to help detect configuration errors (enable with `verbose`).

## Architecture

This tool is a Python application modularized according to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

```

### Phase Detection Logic

The tool identifies the following four phases:

1.  **phase1 (Draft status)**: PR is in Draft status and there is a review request.
2.  **phase2 (Addressing review comments)**: `copilot-pull-request-reviewer` has posted review comments, and corrections are needed.
3.  **phase3 (Awaiting review)**: `copilot-swe-agent` has completed corrections, and is awaiting human review.
4.  **LLM working (Coding agent in progress)**: None of the above apply (e.g., Copilot is in the process of implementation).

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher is installed.
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) is installed and authenticated.
  ```bash
  gh auth login
  ```

### Setup

1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cat2151/cat-github-watcher.git
    cd cat-github-watcher
    ```

2.  Create a configuration file (optional):
    ```bash
    cp config.toml.example config.toml
    ```

3.  Edit `config.toml` to configure monitoring interval, execution mode, ntfy.sh notifications, Copilot auto-assignment, and auto-merge (optional):
    ```toml
    # Check interval (e.g., "30s", "1m", "5m", "1h", "1d")
    interval = "1m"
    
    # Upper limit for the number of issues to display from repositories without open PRs
    # Default is 10, but can be changed to any positive number (e.g., 5, 15, 20)
    issue_display_limit = 10
    
    # Timeout duration for no state change
    # If the state of all PRs (the phase of each PR) does not change for this duration,
    # the monitoring interval will switch to power-saving mode (reduced_frequency_interval below).
    # Set to an empty string "" to disable.
    # Supported formats: "30s", "1m", "5m", "30m", "1h", "1d"
    # Default: "30m" (30 minutes - stability prioritized)
    no_change_timeout = "30m"
    
    # Override the coding agent mention used in posted comments (defaults to @copilot)
    [coding_agent]
    agent_name = "@codex[agent]"
    
    # Monitoring interval in power-saving mode
    # If no state change is detected during the no_change_timeout period,
    # the monitoring interval will switch to this interval to reduce API usage.
    # When a change is detected, it returns to the normal monitoring interval.
    # Supported formats: "30s", "1m", "5m", "30m", "1h", "1d"
    # Default: "1h" (1 hour)
    reduced_frequency_interval = "1h"
    
    # Verbose Mode - Display detailed configuration information
    # When enabled, all configurations are displayed at startup, and per-repository configurations are shown during execution.
    # Helps detect configuration errors.
    # Default: false
    verbose = false
    
    # Toggle PR author display
    # Controls whether "Author: <login>" is displayed in CLI output.
    # Default: false
    display_pr_author = false
    
    # Execution control flags - only configurable within the [[rulesets]] section
    # Global flags are no longer supported
    # To apply settings to all repositories, use 'repositories = ["all"]'
    
    # Ruleset configuration example:
    # [[rulesets]]
    # name = "Default for all repositories - dry-run mode"
    # repositories = ["all"]  # "all" matches all repositories
    # enable_execution_phase1_to_phase2 = false  # Set to true to ready draft PRs
    # enable_execution_phase2_to_phase3 = false  # Set to true to post phase2 comments
    # enable_execution_phase3_send_ntfy = false  # Set to true to send ntfy notifications
    # enable_execution_phase3_to_merge = false   # Set to true to merge phase3 PRs
    
    # [[rulesets]]
    # name = "Simple: Auto-assign good first issues to Copilot"
    # repositories = ["my-repo"]
    # assign_good_first_old = true  # This is enough! The [assign_to_copilot] section is not needed
    #                               # Default behavior: Opens the issue in a browser for manual assignment
    
    # ntfy.sh notification settings (optional)
    # Notifications include a clickable action button to open the PR
    [ntfy]
    enabled = false  # Set to true to enable notifications
    topic = "<Enter your ntfy.sh topic name here>"  # Anyone can read/write, so use a string that cannot be easily guessed
    message = "PR is ready for review: {url}"  # Message template
    priority = 4  # Notification priority (1=lowest, 3=default, 4=high, 5=highest)
    all_phase3_message = "All PRs are now in phase3 (ready for review)"  # Message when all PRs are in phase3
    
    # Phase3 Auto-merge settings (optional)
    # Automatically merges PRs once they reach phase3 (awaiting review).
    # Before merging, the comment defined below will be posted to the PR.
    # After successful merge, the feature branch will be automatically deleted.
    # IMPORTANT: For safety, this feature is disabled by default.
    # You must explicitly enable it by specifying enable_execution_phase3_to_merge = true in the rulesets for each repository.
    # IMPORTANT: If auto-merge is enabled, the comment field must be explicitly set.
    [phase3_merge]
    comment = "The agent has determined that review comments have been addressed. User review is skipped under user responsibility. Merging the PR."  # Comment to post before merging (required when auto-merge is enabled)
    automated = false  # Set to true to click the merge button via browser automation.
    wait_seconds = 10  # Wait time (seconds) after browser launch, before clicking the button.
    debug_dir = "debug_screenshots"  # Destination for debug info on image recognition failure (default: "debug_screenshots")
    
    # Auto-assign issues to Copilot (completely optional! This entire section is optional)
    # 
    # Simple usage: just set assign_good_first_old = true in rulesets (see example above)
    # Define this section only if you want to customize the default behavior.
    # 
    # Assignment behavior is controlled by ruleset flags:
    # - assign_ci_failure_old: Assigns the oldest "ci-failure" issue (by issue number, default: false)
    # - assign_deploy_pages_failure_old: Assigns the oldest "deploy-pages-failure" issue (by issue number, default: false)
    # - assign_good_first_old: Assigns the oldest "good first issue" (by issue number, default: false)
    # - assign_old: Assigns the oldest issue (by issue number, any label, default: false)
    # Priority: ci-failure > deploy-pages-failure > good first issue > old issue
    # 
    # Default behavior (if this section is not defined):
    # - Automatically clicks buttons via browser automation
    # - Image recognition using PyAutoGUI
    # - OCR fallback if image recognition fails (optional)
    # - wait_seconds = 10
    # 
    # REQUIRED: PyAutoGUI installation is required (pip install pyautogui pillow)
    # OPTIONAL: pytesseract installation is required for OCR fallback
    # 
    # IMPORTANT: For safety, this feature is disabled by default.
    # You must explicitly enable it by specifying assign_ci_failure_old / assign_deploy_pages_failure_old /
    # assign_good_first_old / assign_old in the rulesets for each repository.
    [assign_to_copilot]
    wait_seconds = 10  # Wait time (seconds) after browser launch, before clicking the button.
    debug_dir = "debug_screenshots"  # Destination for debug info on image recognition failure (default: "debug_screenshots")
    confidence = 0.8  # Image matching confidence 0.0-1.0 (default: 0.8)
    enable_ocr_detection = true  # Enable OCR fallback (default: true)
    # enable_html_detection = false  # HTML detection fallback (experimental, default: false)
    ```

4.  **Preparing Button Screenshots (for automation only)**:
   
    If you are using automation features (e.g., `automated = true` or enabling `assign_to_copilot` / `phase3_merge`),
    screenshots of the buttons that PyAutoGUI will click are required.
   
    **Required Screenshots:**
   
    For automatic issue assignment (`assign_to_copilot` feature):
    - `assign_to_copilot.png` - Screenshot of the "Assign to Copilot" button
    - `assign.png` - Screenshot of the "Assign" button
   
    For automatic PR merging (if `automated = true` in `phase3_merge` feature):
    - `merge_pull_request.png` - Screenshot of the "Merge pull request" button
    - `confirm_merge.png` - Screenshot of the "Confirm merge" button
    - `delete_branch.png` - Screenshot of the "Delete branch" button (optional)
   
    **How to Take Screenshots:**
   
    a. Open the GitHub issue or PR in your browser
    b. Find the button you want to automate
    c. Take a screenshot of **only the button** (not the entire screen)
    d. Save it in PNG format to the `screenshots` directory
    e. Use the exact filenames specified above
   
    **Tips:**
    - Screenshots should contain only the button, with a small margin.
    - Use your OS's screenshot tool (Windows: Snipping Tool, Mac: Cmd+Shift+4)
    - Ensure the button is clearly visible and not obscured.
    - If the button's appearance changes (e.g., due to theme changes), you'll need to update the screenshots.
    - Use the `confidence` setting to adjust image recognition reliability (due to DPI scaling or themes).
   
    **Automatic Saving of Debug Information:**
    - If image recognition fails, debug information is automatically saved.
    - Destination: `debug_screenshots/` directory (default)
    - Saved content:
      - Screenshot (full screen at time of failure): `{button_name}_fail_{timestamp}.png`
      - Screenshot of candidate regions (if found): `{button_name}_candidate_{timestamp}_{number}.png`
      - Failure information JSON: `{button_name}_fail_{timestamp}.json`
        - Button name, timestamp, confidence threshold, screenshot path, template image path
        - Candidate region information (coordinates, size, confidence)
    - During debugging, up to 3 candidate regions are detected with low confidence (0.7, 0.6, 0.5).
    - The debug directory can be changed in settings: `debug_dir` option (within `assign_to_copilot` or `phase3_merge` section).
   
    **Fallback Methods (if image recognition fails):**
    - **OCR Detection (enabled by default)**: Uses pytesseract to detect button text.
      - Directly detects text like "Assign to Copilot" from the screen.
      - Robust against sub-pixel rendering differences.
      - REQUIRED: tesseract-ocr installation (system level)
      - Disable: `enable_ocr_detection = false`
   
    **Important Requirements:**
    - You must be **already logged into GitHub** in your default browser.
    - Automation uses an existing browser session (it does not perform new authentication).
    - Ensure the correct GitHub window/tab is focused and visible on screen when clicking buttons.
    - If multiple GitHub pages are open, the first found button will be clicked.
   
    **Create the screenshots directory:**
    ```bash
    mkdir screenshots
    ```

5.  Install PyAutoGUI (for automation only):
   
    For basic image recognition only:
    ```bash
    pip install pyautogui pillow pygetwindow
    ```
   
    Including OCR fallback (recommended):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements-automation.txt
    ```
   
    If using OCR, install tesseract-ocr on your system:
    - **Windows**: `choco install tesseract`
    - **macOS**: `brew install tesseract`
    - **Linux**: `apt-get install tesseract-ocr`

### Execution

Start the tool to begin monitoring:

```bash
python3 cat-github-watcher.py [config.toml]
```

Or, run directly as a Python module:

```bash
python3 -m src.gh_pr_phase_monitor.main [config.toml]
```

### Workflow

1.  **Startup**: When the tool starts, it begins monitoring user-owned repositories of authenticated GitHub users.
2.  **PR Detection**: Automatically detects repositories with open PRs.
3.  **Phase Determination**: Determines the phase of each PR (phase1/2/3, LLM working).
4.  **Action Execution**:
    - **phase1**: Default is Dry-run (setting `enable_execution_phase1_to_phase2 = true` in rulesets will change Draft PRs to Ready status).
    - **phase2**: Default is Dry-run (setting `enable_execution_phase2_to_phase3 = true` in rulesets will post a comment requesting Copilot to apply changes).
    - **phase3**: Opens the PR page in the browser.
      - Setting `enable_execution_phase3_send_ntfy = true` in rulesets will also send ntfy.sh notifications.
      - Setting `enable_execution_phase3_to_merge = true` in rulesets will auto-merge PRs (using global `[phase3_merge]` settings).
    - **LLM working**: Wait (if all PRs are in this state, displays issues from repositories with no open PRs).
5.  **Issue Auto-assignment**: If all PRs are "LLM working" and there are repositories without open PRs:
    - Setting `assign_ci_failure_old = true` in rulesets will auto-assign the oldest "ci-failure" issue (by issue number).
    - Setting `assign_deploy_pages_failure_old = true` in rulesets will auto-assign the oldest "deploy-pages-failure" issue (by issue number).
    - Setting `assign_good_first_old = true` in rulesets will auto-assign the oldest "good first issue" (by issue number).
    - Setting `assign_old = true` in rulesets will auto-assign the oldest issue (by issue number, any label).
    - Priority: ci-failure > deploy-pages-failure > good first issue > old issue.
    - Default behavior: Automatically clicks buttons with PyAutoGUI (the `[assign_to_copilot]` section is not needed).
    - REQUIRED: PyAutoGUI installation and button screenshot preparation are necessary.
6.  **Repetition**: Continues monitoring at the configured interval.
    - If no state change persists for the duration set by `no_change_timeout`, it automatically switches to power-saving mode (`reduced_frequency_interval`) to reduce API usage.
    - When a change is detected, it returns to the normal monitoring interval.

### Dry-run Mode

By default, the tool operates in **Dry-run Mode** and does not perform actual actions. This allows you to safely verify its operation.

-   **Phase1 (Draft → Ready)**: `[DRY-RUN] Would mark PR as ready for review` is displayed, but nothing is actually done.
-   **Phase2 (Comment Posting)**: `[DRY-RUN] Would post comment for phase2` is displayed, but nothing is actually done.
-   **Phase3 (ntfy Notification)**: `[DRY-RUN] Would send ntfy notification` is displayed, but nothing is actually done.
-   **Phase3 (Merge)**: `[DRY-RUN] Would merge PR` is displayed, but nothing is actually done.

To enable actual actions, set the following flags to `true` in the `[[rulesets]]` section of `config.toml`:
```toml
[[rulesets]]
name = "Enable automation for specific repositories"
repositories = ["test-repo"]  # or ["all"] for all repositories
enable_execution_phase1_to_phase2 = true  # Ready Draft PRs
enable_execution_phase2_to_phase3 = true  # Post Phase2 comments
enable_execution_phase3_send_ntfy = true  # Send ntfy notifications
enable_execution_phase3_to_merge = true   # Merge Phase3 PRs
assign_ci_failure_old = true              # Auto-assign ci-failure issues
assign_deploy_pages_failure_old = true    # Auto-assign deploy-pages-failure issues
assign_good_first_old = true              # Auto-assign good first issues
```

### Stopping

You can stop monitoring with `Ctrl+C`.

## Notes

- GitHub CLI (`gh`) must be installed and authenticated.
- It assumes integration with GitHub Copilot (especially `copilot-pull-request-reviewer` and `copilot-swe-agent`).
- **Only user-owned repositories** of authenticated users are monitored. Organization repositories are not included to keep the tool simple and focused (YAGNI principle).
- Since the GraphQL API is used, be mindful of API rate limits.
- If using ntfy.sh notifications, configure your topic on [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh/) in advance.

## Testing

The project includes a test suite using pytest:
