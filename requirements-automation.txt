# Optional dependencies for browser automation
# Install with: pip install -r requirements-automation.txt

# PyAutoGUI for image-based button clicking
pyautogui>=0.9.54
pillow>=10.0.0  # Required for screenshot comparison
pygetwindow>=0.0.9  # Required for window activation

# Optional: OCR-based button detection (fallback when image recognition fails)
# Requires tesseract-ocr to be installed on the system
# Windows: choco install tesseract
# macOS: brew install tesseract
# Linux: apt-get install tesseract-ocr
pytesseract>=0.3.10

# Note: Playwright/Selenium HTML-based detection is NOT feasible for this use case
# Reason: Cannot authenticate with GitHub through browser automation due to security restrictions
# The approach of connecting to an already-authenticated browser session via remote debugging
# is too complex and environment-dependent for reliable use
