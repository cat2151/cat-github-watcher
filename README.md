## Status
- Currently dogfooding.
- Major bugs have been addressed.
- Frequent breaking changes.
- Memo
  - Initially, we attempted implementation with GitHub Actions, but it proved unsuitable for PR monitoring, so we transitioned to a Python version.
  - The Python version monitors authenticated GitHub users' owned repositories and performs notifications and actions based on the PR's phase.

## Overview

This is a Python tool that monitors the phases of Pull Requests where GitHub Copilot performs automated implementation, and executes appropriate notifications and actions at the right time.
It targets authenticated GitHub users' owned repositories and efficiently monitors PRs using the GraphQL API.

## Features

- **Automatic monitoring of all repositories**: Automatically monitors PRs in all repositories owned by the authenticated GitHub user.
- **GraphQL API utilization**: Achieves high-speed monitoring through efficient data retrieval.
- **Phase detection**: Automatically determines the PR's status (phase1: Draft state, phase2: Addressing review comments, phase3: Awaiting review, LLM working: Coding agent in progress).
- **Dry-run mode**: By default, only monitoring is performed, and actual actions (posting comments, marking PR as Ready, sending notifications) are not executed. It can be safely operated by explicit activation.
- **Automatic comment posting**: Automatically posts appropriate comments based on the phase (requires activation in the config file).
- **Automatic Draft PR Readying**: Automatically changes a Draft PR to a Ready state for addressing review comments in phase2 (requires activation in the config file).
- **Mobile notifications**: Uses ntfy.sh to send notifications to mobile devices when phase3 (awaiting review) is detected (requires activation in the config file).
  - Notifies when individual PRs enter phase3.
  - Also notifies when all PRs enter phase3 (message configurable in TOML).
- **Issue list display**: If all PRs are "LLM working", displays the top N issues (default: 10, changeable via `issue_display_limit`) for repositories without open PRs.
- **Low-power mode**: If there are no state changes, the monitoring interval is automatically extended to reduce API usage (`no_change_timeout` and `reduced_frequency_interval` are configurable).
- **Verbose mode**: Displays detailed configuration information at startup and during execution to help detect misconfigurations (enable with `verbose`).

## Architecture

This tool is a modularized Python application adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

```

### Phase Detection Logic

The tool detects the following four phases:

1.  **phase1 (Draft state)**: When the PR is in a Draft state and there is a review request.
2.  **phase2 (Addressing review comments)**: When `copilot-pull-request-reviewer` has posted review comments and corrections are needed.
3.  **phase3 (Awaiting review)**: When `copilot-swe-agent` has completed corrections and is awaiting human review.
4.  **LLM working (Coding agent in progress)**: When none of the above apply (e.g., Copilot is implementing).

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher installed.
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated.
  ```bash
  gh auth login
  ```

### Setup

1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cat2151/cat-github-watcher.git
    cd cat-github-watcher
    ```

2.  Create a configuration file (optional):
    ```bash
    cp config.toml.example config.toml
    ```

3.  Edit `config.toml` to set monitoring interval, execution mode, ntfy.sh notifications, Copilot auto-assignment, and auto-merge (optional):
    ```toml
    # Check interval ("30s", "1m", "5m", "1h", "1d", etc.)
    interval = "1m"
    
    # Maximum number of issues to display from repositories with no open PRs
    # Default is 10, but can be changed to any positive number (e.g., 5, 15, 20)
    issue_display_limit = 10
    
    # Timeout duration for no state change
    # If the state of all PRs (the phase of each PR) does not change for this duration,
    # the monitoring interval will switch to low-power mode (reduced_frequency_interval below).
    # Set to an empty string "" to disable.
    # Supported formats: "30s", "1m", "5m", "30m", "1h", "1d"
    # Default: "30m" (30 minutes - stability priority)
    no_change_timeout = "30m"
    
    # Overwrite the coding agent mention used in posted comments (defaults to @copilot if omitted)
    [coding_agent]
    agent_name = "@codex[agent]"
    
    # Monitoring interval in low-power mode
    # If no state changes are detected within the no_change_timeout period,
    # the monitoring interval will switch to this interval to reduce API usage.
    # It will revert to the normal monitoring interval when a change is detected.
    # Supported formats: "30s", "1m", "5m", "30m", "1h", "1d"
    # Default: "1h" (1 hour)
    reduced_frequency_interval = "1h"
    
    # Verbose mode - displays detailed configuration information
    # If enabled, all settings will be displayed at startup, and repository-specific settings during execution.
    # Helps detect configuration errors.
    # Default: false
    verbose = false
    
    # Toggle display of PR author
    # Controls whether to display "Author: <login>" in CLI output.
    # Default: false
    display_pr_author = false
    
    # Execution control flags - can only be specified within the [[rulesets]] section
    # Global flags are no longer supported.
    # To apply settings to all repositories, use 'repositories = ["all"]'.
    
    # Example ruleset configuration:
    # [[rulesets]]
    # name = "Default for all repositories - dry-run mode"
    # repositories = ["all"]  # "all" matches all repositories
    # enable_execution_phase1_to_phase2 = false  # Set to true to ready draft PRs
    # enable_execution_phase2_to_phase3 = false  # Set to true to post phase2 comments
    # enable_execution_phase3_send_ntfy = false  # Set to true to send ntfy notifications
    # enable_execution_phase3_to_merge = false   # Set to true to merge phase3 PRs
    
    # [[rulesets]]
    # name = "Simple: Auto-assign good first issues to Copilot"
    # repositories = ["my-repo"]
    # assign_good_first_old = true  # This is all you need! The [assign_to_copilot] section is not required.
    #                               # Default behavior: Opens the issue in a browser for manual assignment.
    
    # ntfy.sh notification settings (optional)
    # Notifications include clickable action buttons to open the PR.
    [ntfy]
    enabled = false  # Set to true to enable notifications
    topic = "<Enter your ntfy.sh topic name here>"  # Use an unguessable string as anyone can read/write to it
    message = "PR is ready for review: {url}"  # Message template
    priority = 4  # Notification priority (1=lowest, 3=default, 4=high, 5=highest)
    all_phase3_message = "All PRs are now in phase3 (ready for review)"  # Message when all PRs enter phase3
    
    # Phase3 auto-merge settings (optional)
    # Automatically merges a PR once it reaches phase3 (awaiting review).
    # Before merging, the comment defined below will be posted to the PR.
    # After a successful merge, the feature branch will be automatically deleted.
    # IMPORTANT: For safety, this feature is disabled by default.
    # It must be explicitly enabled by setting enable_execution_phase3_to_merge = true in the rulesets for each repository.
    # IMPORTANT: If auto-merge is enabled, the 'comment' field must be explicitly set.
    [phase3_merge]
    comment = "The agent has determined that review comments have been addressed. User review is skipped under user responsibility. Merging the PR."  # Comment to post before merging (required when auto-merge is enabled)
    automated = false  # Set to true to click the merge button via browser automation
    wait_seconds = 10  # Wait time (seconds) after browser launch, before clicking the button
    debug_dir = "debug_screenshots"  # Directory for saving debug info on image recognition failure (default: "debug_screenshots")
    
    # Auto-assign issues to Copilot (completely optional! This entire section is optional)
    # 
    # Simple usage: Just set assign_good_first_old = true in rulesets (see example above).
    # Only define this section if you want to customize the default behavior.
    # 
    # Assignment behavior is controlled by ruleset flags:
    # - assign_good_first_old: Assigns the oldest "good first issue" (by issue number, default: false)
    # - assign_old: Assigns the oldest issue (by issue number, any label, default: false)
    # If both are true, "good first issue" takes precedence.
    # 
    # Default behavior (if this section is not defined):
    # - Automatically clicks the button via browser automation
    # - Uses PyAutoGUI for image recognition
    # - OCR fallback if image recognition fails (optional)
    # - wait_seconds = 10
    # 
    # Required: PyAutoGUI installation (pip install pyautogui pillow)
    # Optional: pytesseract installation for OCR fallback
    # 
    # IMPORTANT: For safety, this feature is disabled by default.
    # It must be explicitly enabled by setting assign_good_first_old or assign_old in the rulesets for each repository.
    [assign_to_copilot]
    wait_seconds = 10  # Wait time (seconds) after browser launch, before clicking the button
    debug_dir = "debug_screenshots"  # Directory for saving debug info on image recognition failure (default: "debug_screenshots")
    confidence = 0.8  # Image matching confidence 0.0-1.0 (default: 0.8)
    enable_ocr_detection = true  # Enable OCR fallback (default: true)
    # enable_html_detection = false  # HTML detection fallback (experimental, default: false)
    ```

4.  **Prepare button screenshots (only if using automation)**:
    
    If you use automation features (`automated = true` or enabling `assign_to_copilot` / `phase3_merge`),
    PyAutoGUI requires screenshots of the buttons to click.
    
    **Required screenshots:**
    
    For automatic issue assignment (`assign_to_copilot` feature):
    - `assign_to_copilot.png` - Screenshot of the "Assign to Copilot" button
    - `assign.png` - Screenshot of the "Assign" button
    
    For automatic PR merging (`phase3_merge` feature with `automated = true`):
    - `merge_pull_request.png` - Screenshot of the "Merge pull request" button
    - `confirm_merge.png` - Screenshot of the "Confirm merge" button
    - `delete_branch.png` - Screenshot of the "Delete branch" button (optional)
    
    **How to take screenshots:**
    
    a. Open a GitHub issue or PR in your browser.
    b. Find the button you want to automate.
    c. Take a screenshot of **only the button** (not the entire screen).
    d. Save it as a PNG file in the `screenshots` directory.
    e. Use the exact filenames listed above.
    
    **Tips:**
    - Screenshots should include only the button, with a small margin.
    - Use your OS's screenshot tool (Windows: Snipping Tool, Mac: Cmd+Shift+4).
    - Ensure the button is clearly visible and not obscured.
    - If the button's appearance changes (e.g., due to theme changes), you'll need to update the screenshots.
    - Use the `confidence` setting to adjust image recognition sensitivity (due to DPI scaling or themes).
    
    **Automatic saving of debug information:**
    - If image recognition fails, debug information is automatically saved.
    - Save location: `debug_screenshots/` directory (default).
    - Saved content:
      - Screenshot (entire screen at time of failure): `{button_name}_fail_{timestamp}.png`
      - Screenshot of candidate regions (if found): `{button_name}_candidate_{timestamp}_{number}.png`
      - Failure info JSON: `{button_name}_fail_{timestamp}.json`
        - Button name, timestamp, confidence threshold, screenshot path, template image path.
        - Candidate region information (coordinates, size, confidence).
    - During debugging, up to 3 candidate regions are detected with a lower confidence (0.7, 0.6, 0.5).
    - The debug directory can be changed in the settings: `debug_dir` option (within `assign_to_copilot` or `phase3_merge` sections).
    
    **Fallback methods (if image recognition fails):**
    - **OCR detection (enabled by default)**: Uses pytesseract to detect button text.
      - Directly detects text like "Assign to Copilot" on screen.
      - Robust against sub-pixel rendering differences.
      - Required: tesseract-ocr installation (system-level).
      - Disable: `enable_ocr_detection = false`.
    
    **Important requirements:**
    - Your default browser must already be **logged into GitHub**.
    - Automation uses existing browser sessions (it does not perform new authentication).
    - Ensure the correct GitHub window/tab is focused and visible on screen when a button click occurs.
    - If multiple GitHub pages are open, the first button found will be clicked.
    
    **Create screenshots directory:**
    ```bash
    mkdir screenshots
    ```

5.  Install PyAutoGUI (only if using automation):
    
    For basic image recognition only:
    ```bash
    pip install pyautogui pillow pygetwindow
    ```
    
    Including OCR fallback (recommended):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements-automation.txt
    ```
    
    If using OCR, install tesseract-ocr system-wide:
    - **Windows**: `choco install tesseract`
    - **macOS**: `brew install tesseract`
    - **Linux**: `apt-get install tesseract-ocr`

### Execution

Start the tool to begin monitoring:

```bash
python3 cat-github-watcher.py [config.toml]
```

Or, run directly as a Python module:

```bash
python3 -m src.gh_pr_phase_monitor.main [config.toml]
```

### Workflow

1.  **Start**: When the tool starts, it begins monitoring repositories owned by the authenticated GitHub user.
2.  **PR Detection**: Automatically detects repositories with open PRs.
3.  **Phase Determination**: Determines the phase of each PR (phase1/2/3, LLM working).
4.  **Action Execution**:
    -   **phase1**: Default is Dry-run (if `enable_execution_phase1_to_phase2 = true` in rulesets, changes Draft PR to Ready state).
    -   **phase2**: Default is Dry-run (if `enable_execution_phase2_to_phase3 = true` in rulesets, posts a comment requesting Copilot to apply changes).
    -   **phase3**: Opens the PR page in the browser.
        -   If `enable_execution_phase3_send_ntfy = true` in rulesets, also sends ntfy.sh notification.
        -   If `enable_execution_phase3_to_merge = true` in rulesets, automatically merges the PR (using global `[phase3_merge]` settings).
    -   **LLM working**: Waits (if all PRs are in this state, displays issues from repositories with no open PRs).
5.  **Issue Auto-assignment**: If all PRs are "LLM working" and there are repositories with no open PRs:
    -   If `assign_good_first_old = true` in rulesets, automatically assigns the oldest "good first issue" (by issue number).
    -   If `assign_old = true` in rulesets, automatically assigns the oldest issue (by issue number, any label).
    -   If both are true, "good first issue" takes precedence.
    -   Default behavior: Automatically clicks the button with PyAutoGUI (the `[assign_to_copilot]` section is not required).
    -   Required: PyAutoGUI installation and button screenshots must be prepared.
6.  **Repeat**: Continues monitoring at the configured interval.
    -   If no state changes are detected for the duration specified by `no_change_timeout`, it automatically switches to low-power mode (`reduced_frequency_interval`) to reduce API usage.
    -   It reverts to the normal monitoring interval when a change is detected.

### Dry-run Mode

By default, the tool operates in **Dry-run mode** and does not execute actual actions. This allows for safe verification of its operation.

-   **Phase1 (Draft → Ready)**: Displays `[DRY-RUN] Would mark PR as ready for review` but does nothing.
-   **Phase2 (Comment Posting)**: Displays `[DRY-RUN] Would post comment for phase2` but does nothing.
-   **Phase3 (ntfy Notification)**: Displays `[DRY-RUN] Would send ntfy notification` but does nothing.
-   **Phase3 (Merge)**: Displays `[DRY-RUN] Would merge PR` but does nothing.

To enable actual actions, set the following flags to `true` in the `[[rulesets]]` section of `config.toml`:
```toml
[[rulesets]]
name = "Enable automation for a specific repository"
repositories = ["test-repo"]  # Or ["all"] for all repositories
enable_execution_phase1_to_phase2 = true  # Ready Draft PRs
enable_execution_phase2_to_phase3 = true  # Post Phase2 comments
enable_execution_phase3_send_ntfy = true  # Send ntfy notifications
enable_execution_phase3_to_merge = true   # Merge Phase3 PRs
assign_good_first_old = true              # Auto-assign good first issues
```

### Stopping

You can stop monitoring by pressing `Ctrl+C`.

## Notes

-   GitHub CLI (`gh`) must be installed and authenticated.
-   This tool is designed to work with GitHub Copilot (specifically `copilot-pull-request-reviewer` and `copilot-swe-agent`).
-   Only **user-owned repositories** of the authenticated user are monitored. Organization repositories are not included to keep the tool simple and focused (YAGNI principle).
-   Be mindful of API rate limits as it uses the GraphQL API.
-   If using ntfy.sh notifications, configure a topic on [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh/) beforehand.

## Tests

The project includes a test suite using pytest:
