## Status
- Currently dogfooding.
- Most major bugs have been fixed.
- Frequent breaking changes occur.
- Notes
  - Initially, we attempted to implement this with GitHub Actions, but it proved unsuitable for PR monitoring, so we transitioned to a Python version.
  - The Python version monitors user-owned repositories of authenticated GitHub users and performs notifications and actions according to the PR's phase.

## Overview

This Python tool monitors the phases of Pull Requests where GitHub Copilot performs automatic implementation, executing appropriate notifications and actions at the right time.
It targets user-owned repositories of authenticated GitHub users, leveraging the GraphQL API for efficient PR monitoring.

## Features

- **Automatic Monitoring of All Repositories**: Automatically monitors PRs in user-owned repositories of authenticated GitHub users.
- **Leveraging GraphQL API**: Achieves fast monitoring through efficient data retrieval.
- **Phase Detection**: Automatically determines PR states (phase1: Draft status, phase2: Addressing review comments, phase3: Awaiting review, LLM working: Coding agent working).
- **Dry-run Mode**: By default, only monitors and does not perform actual actions (posting comments, making PRs ready, sending notifications). Can be safely operated by explicit enablement.
- **Automatic Comment Posting**: Automatically posts appropriate comments based on the phase (Requires: enabling in configuration file).
- **Automatic Draft PR Readiness**: Automatically changes Draft PRs to a Ready state for addressing review feedback in phase2 (Requires: enabling in configuration file).
- **Mobile Notifications**: Uses ntfy.sh to send notifications to mobile devices when phase3 (awaiting review) is detected (Requires: enabling in configuration file).
  - Notifies when individual PRs enter phase3.
  - Also notifies when all PRs enter phase3 (message configurable in toml).
- **Issue List Display**: If all PRs are in "LLM working" state, displays the top 10 issues from repositories with no open PRs.

## Architecture

This tool is a modularized Python application adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

```

### Phase Detection Logic

The tool detects the following four phases:

1.  **phase1 (Draft status)**: The PR is in Draft status and has review requests.
2.  **phase2 (Addressing review comments)**: `copilot-pull-request-reviewer` has posted review comments, and corrections are needed.
3.  **phase3 (Awaiting review)**: `copilot-swe-agent` has completed corrections, and the PR is awaiting human review.
4.  **LLM working (Coding agent working)**: Does not fall into any of the above (e.g., Copilot is implementing).

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x is installed.
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) is installed and authenticated.
  ```bash
  gh auth login
  ```

### Setup

1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cat2151/cat-github-watcher.git
    cd cat-github-watcher
    ```

2.  Create a configuration file (optional):
    ```bash
    cp config.toml.example config.toml
    ```

3.  Edit `config.toml` to configure monitoring interval, execution mode, ntfy.sh notifications, Copilot auto-assignment, and auto-merge (optional):
    ```toml
    # Check interval (e.g., "30s", "1m", "5m", "1h", "1d")
    interval = "1m"
    
    # Execution control flags - can only be specified within the [[rulesets]] section
    # Global flags are no longer supported
    # Use 'repositories = ["all"]' to apply settings to all repositories
    
    # Example ruleset configuration:
    # [[rulesets]]
    # name = "Default for all repositories - dry-run mode"
    # repositories = ["all"]  # "all" matches all repositories
    # enable_execution_phase1_to_phase2 = false  # Set to true to make draft PR ready
    # enable_execution_phase2_to_phase3 = false  # Set to true to post phase2 comments
    # enable_execution_phase3_send_ntfy = false  # Set to true to send ntfy notifications
    # enable_execution_phase3_to_merge = false   # Set to true to merge phase3 PRs
    
    # ntfy.sh notification settings (optional)
    # Notifications include a clickable action button to open the PR
    [ntfy]
    enabled = false  # Set to true to enable notifications
    topic = "<Enter your ntfy.sh topic name here>"  # Use an unguessable string as anyone can read/write to it
    message = "PR is ready for review: {url}"  # Message template
    priority = 4  # Notification priority (1=lowest, 3=default, 4=high, 5=highest)
    all_phase3_message = "All PRs are now in phase3 (ready for review)"  # Message when all PRs are in phase3
    
    # Phase3 auto-merge settings (optional)
    # Automatically merges the PR when it reaches phase3 (awaiting review)
    # Before merging, the comment defined below will be posted to the PR
    # After successful merge, the feature branch will be automatically deleted
    [phase3_merge]
    enabled = false  # Set to true to enable auto-merge (requires enable_execution_phase3_to_merge = true in rulesets)
    comment = "All checks passed. Merging PR."  # Comment to post before merging
    automated = false  # Set to true to automatically click the merge button via browser automation
    automation_backend = "selenium"  # Automation backend: "selenium" or "playwright"
    wait_seconds = 10  # Wait time in seconds after browser launch, before clicking the button
    browser = "edge"  # Browser to use: Selenium: "edge", "chrome", "firefox" / Playwright: "chromium", "firefox", "webkit"
    headless = false  # Run in headless mode (do not display browser window)
    
    # Automatically assign "good first issue" issues to Copilot (optional)
    # If enabled, it will open the issue in the browser and prompt you to click "Assign to Copilot" button
    # Setting automated = true will automatically click the button via browser automation (requires Selenium)
    [assign_to_copilot]
    enabled = false  # Set to true to enable auto-assign feature
    automated = false  # Set to true to enable browser automation (Requires: pip install selenium webdriver-manager)
    wait_seconds = 10  # Wait time in seconds after browser launch, before clicking the button
    browser = "edge"  # Browser to use ("edge", "chrome", "firefox")
    ```

4.  (Optional) If using browser automation, install Selenium:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements-automation.txt
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    pip install selenium webdriver-manager
    ```
    
    Additionally, you will need the driver for your chosen browser:
    - **Edge**: Included by default in Windows 10/11 (no additional installation needed).
    - **Chrome**: ChromeDriver will be downloaded automatically.
    - **Firefox**: GeckoDriver will be downloaded automatically.
    ```

### Execution

Start the tool to begin monitoring:

```bash
python3 cat-github-watcher.py [config.toml]
```

Or, run directly as a Python module:

```bash
python3 -m src.gh_pr_phase_monitor.main [config.toml]
```

### Workflow

1.  **Startup**: When the tool starts, it begins monitoring user-owned repositories of the authenticated GitHub user.
2.  **PR Detection**: Automatically detects repositories with open PRs.
3.  **Phase Determination**: Determines the phase of each PR (phase1/2/3, LLM working).
4.  **Action Execution**:
    -   **phase1**: Default is Dry-run (`enable_execution_phase1_to_phase2 = true` changes Draft PR to Ready state).
    -   **phase2**: Default is Dry-run (`enable_execution_phase2_to_phase3 = true` posts a comment asking Copilot to apply changes).
    -   **phase3**: Opens the PR page in the browser (`enable_execution_phase3_send_ntfy = true` also sends ntfy.sh notifications, `enable_execution_phase3_to_merge = true` automatically merges the PR).
    -   **LLM working**: Waits (if all PRs are in this state, it displays issues from repositories without open PRs).
5.  **Repetition**: Continues monitoring at the configured interval.

### Dry-run Mode

By default, the tool operates in **Dry-run mode** and does not perform actual actions. This allows for safe verification of its operation.

-   **Phase1 (Draft → Ready)**: Displays `[DRY-RUN] Would mark PR as ready for review` but does nothing actually.
-   **Phase2 (Comment Posting)**: Displays `[DRY-RUN] Would post comment for phase2` but does nothing actually.
-   **Phase3 (ntfy Notification)**: Displays `[DRY-RUN] Would send ntfy notification` but does nothing actually.
-   **Phase3 (Merge)**: Displays `[DRY-RUN] Would merge PR` but does nothing actually.

To enable actual actions, set the following flags to `true` in `config.toml`:
```toml
enable_execution_phase1_to_phase2 = true  # Make Draft PR ready
enable_execution_phase2_to_phase3 = true  # Post Phase2 comment
enable_execution_phase3_send_ntfy = true  # Send ntfy notification
enable_execution_phase3_to_merge = true   # Merge Phase3 PR
```

### Stopping

You can stop monitoring by pressing `Ctrl+C`.

## Important Considerations

-   GitHub CLI (`gh`) must be installed and authenticated.
-   Assumes integration with GitHub Copilot (specifically `copilot-pull-request-reviewer` and `copilot-swe-agent`).
-   **Only user-owned repositories** of the authenticated user are monitored. Organization repositories are not included to keep the tool simple and focused (YAGNI principle).
-   Be mindful of API rate limits when using the GraphQL API.
-   If using ntfy.sh notifications, set up a topic on [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh/) beforehand.
