## Status
- Currently dogfooding.
- Major bugs have been addressed.
- Frequent breaking changes may occur.
- Memo
  - Initially, implementation was attempted with GitHub Actions, but it proved unsuitable for PR monitoring, so we transitioned to a Python version.
  - The Python version monitors user-owned repositories for authenticated GitHub users and performs notifications and actions based on PR phases.

## Overview

This Python tool monitors the phases of pull requests where GitHub Copilot performs automated implementation, executing appropriate notifications and actions at the right time. It efficiently monitors PRs in user-owned repositories of authenticated GitHub users by leveraging the GraphQL API.

## Features

- **Automatic Monitoring of All Repositories**: Automatically monitors PRs in user-owned repositories for authenticated GitHub users.
- **GraphQL API Utilization**: Achieves high-speed monitoring through efficient data retrieval.
- **Phase Detection**: Automatically determines the PR state (phase1: Draft state, phase2: Addressing review comments, phase3: Awaiting review, LLM working: Coding agent in progress).
- **Dry-run Mode**: By default, only monitoring is performed, and actual actions (posting comments, marking PR as ready, sending notifications) are not executed. It can be safely operated by explicit enablement.
- **Automatic Comment Posting**: Automatically posts appropriate comments based on the phase (requires enablement in config file).
- **Multi-Agent Support**: Automatically mentions `@codex[agent]` if the PR author is `openai-code-agent` or similar `*-codex-coding-agent` series, `@claude[agent]` if `anthropic-code-agent` or similar `*-claude-coding-agent` series, and falls back to `@copilot` otherwise (can be overridden by `[coding_agent].agent_name`, defaults to `@copilot` if not set).
- **Automatic Draft PR Readiness**: Automatically changes Draft PRs to a Ready state to address review comments in phase2 (requires enablement in config file).
- **Mobile Notifications**: Uses ntfy.sh to send notifications to mobile devices when phase3 (awaiting review) is detected (requires enablement in config file).
  - Notifies when individual PRs enter phase3.
  - Also notifies when all PRs enter phase3 (message configurable in toml).
- **Issue List Display**: If all PRs are in "LLM working" state, displays the top N issues (default: 10, configurable via `issue_display_limit`) for repositories with no open PRs.
- **Self-Update**: If `enable_auto_update = true` is set, detects GitHub repository updates every minute and automatically pulls and restarts if the working tree is clean and fast-forwardable (disabled by default).
- **Reduced Frequency Mode**: If no state changes occur, the monitoring interval is automatically extended to reduce API usage (configurable via `no_change_timeout` and `reduced_frequency_interval`).
- **Verbose Mode**: Displays detailed configuration information at startup and during execution to help detect configuration errors (enabled by `verbose`).

## Architecture

This tool is a modular Python application adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

```

### Phase Detection Logic

The tool detects the following four phases:

1.  **phase1 (Draft State)**: PR is in Draft state and has review requests.
2.  **phase2 (Addressing Review Comments)**: `copilot-pull-request-reviewer` has posted review comments, and corrections are needed.
3.  **phase3 (Awaiting Review)**: `copilot-swe-agent` has completed corrections, and human review is pending.
4.  **LLM working (Coding Agent in Progress)**: None of the above apply (e.g., Copilot is implementing).

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher installed.
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated.
  ```bash
  gh auth login
  ```

### Setup

1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cat2151/cat-github-watcher.git
    cd cat-github-watcher
    ```

2.  Create a configuration file (optional):
    ```bash
    cp config.toml.example config.toml
    ```

3.  Edit `config.toml` to set monitoring interval, execution mode, ntfy.sh notifications, Copilot auto-assignment, and auto-merge (optional):
    ```toml
    # Check interval (e.g., "30s", "1m", "5m", "1h", "1d")
    interval = "1m"
    
    # Max number of issues to display from repositories with no open PRs
    # Default is 10, but can be changed to any positive number (e.g., 5, 15, 20)
    issue_display_limit = 10
    
    # Timeout for no state change
    # If the state of all PRs (the phase of each PR) does not change for this duration,
    # the monitoring interval will switch to reduced frequency mode (reduced_frequency_interval below).
    # Set to an empty string "" to disable.
    # Supported formats: "30s", "1m", "5m", "30m", "1h", "1d"
    # Default: "30m" (30 minutes - prioritizing stability)
    no_change_timeout = "30m"
    
    # Override coding agent mention for comments (defaults to @copilot)
    [coding_agent]
    agent_name = "@codex[agent]"
    
    # Monitoring interval in reduced frequency mode
    # If no state changes are detected during the no_change_timeout period,
    # the monitoring interval will switch to this interval to reduce API usage.
    # Once a change is detected, it returns to the regular monitoring interval.
    # Supported formats: "30s", "1m", "5m", "30m", "1h", "1d"
    # Default: "1h" (1 hour)
    reduced_frequency_interval = "1h"
    
    # Verbose mode - displays detailed configuration information
    # When enabled, all settings are displayed at startup, and per-repository settings are shown during execution.
    # Helps detect configuration errors.
    # Default: false
    verbose = false
    
    # Terminal output color scheme
    # Can be set to monokai (default) or classic
    color_scheme = "monokai"

    # Individual color codes can be overridden in the [colors] section (#RRGGBB format/ANSI supported)
    # If omitted, the palette of the above color_scheme is used
    [colors]
    # phase1 = "#E6DB74"
    # phase2 = "#66D9EF"
    # phase3 = "#A6E22E"
    # llm = "#F92672"
    # url = "#79C1FF"
    # url = "\u001b[94m"  # Example ANSI in TOML (ESC=[94m)
    
    # Toggle PR author display

    # Default: false
    display_pr_author = false
    
    # Execution control flags - can only be specified within the [[rulesets]] section
    # Global flags are no longer supported.
    # To apply settings to all repositories, use 'repositories = ["all"]'.
    
    # Example ruleset configuration:
    # [[rulesets]]
    # name = "Default for all repositories - dry-run mode"
    # repositories = ["all"]  # "all" matches all repositories
    # enable_execution_phase1_to_phase2 = false  # Set to true to ready draft PRs
    # enable_execution_phase2_to_phase3 = false  # Set to true to post phase2 comments
    # enable_execution_phase3_send_ntfy = false  # Set to true to send ntfy notifications
    # enable_execution_phase3_to_merge = false   # Set to true to merge phase3 PRs
    
    # [[rulesets]]
    # name = "Simple: Auto-assign good first issues to Copilot"
    # repositories = ["my-repo"]
    # assign_good_first_old = true  # This alone is enough! [assign_to_copilot] section is not needed
    #                               # Default behavior: Opens issue in browser for manual assignment
    
    # ntfy.sh notification settings (optional)
    # Notifications include clickable action buttons to open the PR.
    [ntfy]
    enabled = false  # Set to true to enable notifications
    topic = "<Enter your ntfy.sh topic name here>"  # Make it an unguessable string, as anyone can read/write to it
    message = "PR is ready for review: {url}"  # Message template
    priority = 4  # Notification priority (1=min, 3=default, 4=high, 5=max)
    all_phase3_message = "All PRs are now in phase3 (ready for review)"  # Message when all PRs are in phase3
    
    # Phase3 auto-merge settings (optional)
    # Automatically merges the PR once it reaches phase3 (awaiting review).
    # Before merging, a comment defined below will be posted to the PR.
    # After a successful merge, the feature branch will be automatically deleted.
    # IMPORTANT: For safety, this feature is disabled by default.
    # You must explicitly enable it by specifying enable_execution_phase3_to_merge = true in rulesets for each repository.
    # IMPORTANT: If auto-merge is enabled, the 'comment' field must be explicitly set.
    [phase3_merge]
    comment = "The agent determines that review comments have been addressed. User review is skipped under user responsibility. Merging the PR."  # Comment to post before merging (required when auto-merge is enabled)
    automated = false  # Set to true to click merge button via browser automation
    wait_seconds = 10  # Waiting time (seconds) after browser launch, before button click
    debug_dir = "debug_screenshots"  # Directory to save debug info on image recognition failure (default: "debug_screenshots")
    notification_enabled = true  # Display a small notification window at specified coordinates during button automation
    notification_message = "Opening browser and searching for Merge button..."  # Message in the notification window
    notification_width = 400
    notification_height = 150
    notification_position_x = 100
    notification_position_y = 100
    maximize_on_first_fail = true  # Maximize window and re-search if button not found on first attempt

    # Auto-assign issues to Copilot (completely optional! This entire section is optional)
    # 
    # Simple usage: Just set assign_good_first_old = true in rulesets (see example above).
    # Define this section ONLY if you want to customize the default behavior.
    # 
    # Assignment behavior is controlled by ruleset flags:
    # - assign_ci_failure_old: Assigns the oldest "ci-failure" issue (by issue number, default: false)
    # - assign_deploy_pages_failure_old: Assigns the oldest "deploy-pages-failure" issue (by issue number, default: false)
    # - assign_good_first_old: Assigns the oldest "good first issue" (by issue number, default: false)
    # - assign_old: Assigns the oldest issue (by issue number, any label, default: false)
    # Priority: ci-failure > deploy-pages-failure > good first issue > old issue
    # 
    # Default behavior (if this section is not defined):
    # - Automatically clicks buttons via browser automation
    # - Uses image recognition with PyAutoGUI
    # - OCR fallback (optional) if image recognition fails
    # - wait_seconds = 2
    # 
    # REQUIRED: PyAutoGUI installation is needed (pip install pyautogui pillow)
    # OPTIONAL: pytesseract installation is needed for OCR fallback
    # 
    # IMPORTANT: For safety, this feature is disabled by default.
    # You must explicitly enable it by specifying assign_ci_failure_old / assign_deploy_pages_failure_old /
    # assign_good_first_old / assign_old in rulesets for each repository.
    [assign_to_copilot]
    wait_seconds = 2  # Waiting time (seconds) after browser launch, before button click
    debug_dir = "debug_screenshots"  # Directory to save debug info on image recognition failure (default: "debug_screenshots")
    confidence = 0.8  # Image matching confidence 0.0-1.0 (default: 0.8)
    enable_ocr_detection = true  # Enable OCR fallback (default: true)
    notification_enabled = true  # Display a small notification window at specified coordinates during button automation
    notification_message = "Opening browser and searching for Copilot assignment button..."  # Message in the notification window
    notification_width = 400
    notification_height = 150
    notification_position_x = 100
    notification_position_y = 100
    maximize_on_first_fail = true  # Maximize window and re-search if button not found on first attempt
    # enable_html_detection = false  # HTML detection fallback (experimental, default: false)
    ```

4.  **Prepare button screenshots (only if using automation)**:
    
    If using automation features (`automated = true` or enabling `assign_to_copilot` / `phase3_merge`),
    PyAutoGUI requires screenshots of the buttons to click.
    
    **Required screenshots:**
    
    For automated issue assignment (`assign_to_copilot` feature):
    - `assign_to_copilot.png` - Screenshot of the "Assign to Copilot" button
    - `assign.png` - Screenshot of the "Assign" button
    
    For automated PR merging (if `automated = true` in `phase3_merge` feature):
    - `merge_pull_request.png` - Screenshot of the "Merge pull request" button
    - `confirm_merge.png` - Screenshot of the "Confirm merge" button
    - `delete_branch.png` - Screenshot of the "Delete branch" button (optional)
    
    **How to take screenshots:**
    
    a. Open a GitHub issue or PR in your browser.
    b. Locate the button you want to automate.
    c. Take a screenshot of **only the button** (not the entire screen).
    d. Save it in PNG format to the `screenshots` directory.
    e. Use the exact filenames listed above.
    
    **Tips:**
    - Screenshots should include only the button, with a small margin.
    - Use your OS's screenshot tool (Windows: Snipping Tool, Mac: Cmd+Shift+4).
    - Ensure the button is clearly visible and not obscured.
    - If the button's appearance changes (e.g., due to theme changes), you'll need to update the screenshots.
    - If adjusting image recognition confidence, use the `confidence` setting (due to DPI scaling or themes).
    
    **Automatic saving of debug information:**
    - If image recognition fails, debug information is automatically saved.
    - Save location: `debug_screenshots/` directory (default).
    - Contents saved:
      - Screenshot (full screen at time of failure): `{button_name}_fail_{timestamp}.png`
      - Candidate region screenshots (if found): `{button_name}_candidate_{timestamp}_{number}.png`
      - Failure info JSON: `{button_name}_fail_{timestamp}.json`
        - Button name, timestamp, confidence threshold, screenshot path, template image path.
        - Candidate region information (coordinates, size, confidence).
    - For debugging, up to 3 candidate regions are detected with lower confidence (0.7, 0.6, 0.5).
    - The debug directory can be changed in settings: `debug_dir` option (within `assign_to_copilot` or `phase3_merge` sections).
    
    **Fallback methods (if image recognition fails):**
    - **OCR Detection (enabled by default)**: Uses pytesseract to detect button text.
      - Directly detects text like "Assign to Copilot" on screen.
      - Robust against sub-pixel rendering differences.
      - REQUIRED: tesseract-ocr must be installed (system-level).
      - Disable: `enable_ocr_detection = false`.
    
    **Important requirements:**
    - You must be **already logged in to GitHub** in your default browser.
    - Automation uses your existing browser session (no new authentication is performed).
    - Ensure the correct GitHub window/tab is focused and visible on screen when clicking buttons.
    - If multiple GitHub pages are open, the first found button will be clicked.
    
    **Create screenshots directory:**
    ```bash
    mkdir screenshots
    ```

5.  Install PyAutoGUI (only if using automation):
    
    For basic image recognition only:
    ```bash
    pip install pyautogui pillow pygetwindow
    ```
    
    Including OCR fallback (recommended):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements-automation.txt
    ```
    
    If using OCR, install tesseract-ocr on your system:
    - **Windows**: `choco install tesseract`
    - **macOS**: `brew install tesseract`
    - **Linux**: `apt-get install tesseract-ocr`

### Execution

Start the tool to begin monitoring:

```bash
python3 cat-github-watcher.py [config.toml]
```

Alternatively, run directly as a Python module:

```bash
python3 -m src.gh_pr_phase_monitor.main [config.toml]
```

### Workflow

1.  **Startup**: When the tool starts, it begins monitoring user-owned repositories for the authenticated GitHub user.
2.  **PR Detection**: Automatically detects repositories with open PRs.
3.  **Phase Determination**: Determines the phase of each PR (phase1/2/3, LLM working).
4.  **Action Execution**:
    -   **phase1**: Default is Dry-run (if `enable_execution_phase1_to_phase2 = true` in rulesets, Draft PR is changed to Ready state).
    -   **phase2**: Default is Dry-run (if `enable_execution_phase2_to_phase3 = true` in rulesets, a comment is posted asking Copilot to apply changes).
    -   **phase3**: Opens the PR page in the browser.
        -   If `enable_execution_phase3_send_ntfy = true` in rulesets, an ntfy.sh notification is also sent.
        -   If `enable_execution_phase3_to_merge = true` in rulesets, the PR is automatically merged (uses global `[phase3_merge]` settings).
    -   **LLM working**: Waits (if all PRs are in this state, issues from repositories with no open PRs are displayed).
5.  **Automated Issue Assignment**: If all PRs are "LLM working" and there are repositories with no open PRs:
    -   If `assign_ci_failure_old = true` in rulesets, the oldest "ci-failure" issue is automatically assigned (by issue number).
    -   If `assign_deploy_pages_failure_old = true` in rulesets, the oldest "deploy-pages-failure" issue is automatically assigned (by issue number).
    -   If `assign_good_first_old = true` in rulesets, the oldest "good first issue" is automatically assigned (by issue number).
    -   If `assign_old = true` in rulesets, the oldest issue is automatically assigned (by issue number, any label).
    -   Priority: ci-failure > deploy-pages-failure > good first issue > old issue.
    -   Default behavior: Automatically clicks buttons with PyAutoGUI (the `[assign_to_copilot]` section is not needed).
    -   REQUIRED: PyAutoGUI installation and button screenshots must be prepared.
6.  **Repeat**: Continues monitoring at the configured interval.
    -   If no state changes are detected for the duration set by `no_change_timeout`, it automatically switches to reduced frequency mode (`reduced_frequency_interval`) to reduce API usage.
    -   Once a change is detected, it returns to the regular monitoring interval.

### Dry-run Mode

By default, the tool operates in **Dry-run Mode** and does not execute actual actions. This allows you to safely verify its operation.

-   **Phase1 (Draft → Ready)**: Displays `[DRY-RUN] Would mark PR as ready for review` but does nothing actually.
-   **Phase2 (Comment Posting)**: Displays `[DRY-RUN] Would post comment for phase2` but does nothing actually.
-   **Phase3 (ntfy Notification)**: Displays `[DRY-RUN] Would send ntfy notification` but does nothing actually.
-   **Phase3 (Merge)**: Displays `[DRY-RUN] Would merge PR` but does nothing actually.

To enable actual actions, set the following flags to `true` in the `[[rulesets]]` section of `config.toml`:
```toml
[[rulesets]]
name = "Enable automation for specific repository"
repositories = ["test-repo"]  # Or ["all"] for all repositories
enable_execution_phase1_to_phase2 = true  # Ready Draft PRs
enable_execution_phase2_to_phase3 = true  # Post Phase2 comments
enable_execution_phase3_send_ntfy = true  # Send ntfy notifications
enable_execution_phase3_to_merge = true   # Merge Phase3 PRs
assign_ci_failure_old = true              # Auto-assign ci-failure issues
assign_deploy_pages_failure_old = true    # Auto-assign deploy-pages-failure issues
assign_good_first_old = true              # Auto-assign good first issues
```

### Stopping

You can stop monitoring with `Ctrl+C`.

## Cautions

-   GitHub CLI (`gh`) must be installed and authenticated.
-   It assumes integration with GitHub Copilot (specifically `copilot-pull-request-reviewer` and `copilot-swe-agent`).
-   Only **user-owned repositories** of the authenticated user are monitored. Organization repositories are not included to keep the tool simple and focused (YAGNI principle).
-   Be mindful of API rate limits as it uses the GraphQL API.
-   If using ntfy.sh notifications, configure a topic on [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh/) beforehand.
