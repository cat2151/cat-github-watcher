## Status
- Currently dogfooding.
- Major bugs have been addressed.
- Frequent breaking changes are expected.
- Memo
  - Initially, we attempted implementation with GitHub Actions, but it was found unsuitable for the purpose of PR monitoring, so we transitioned to a Python version.
  - The Python version monitors repositories owned by authenticated GitHub users and performs notifications and actions based on the PR phase.

## Overview

This Python tool monitors the phases of Pull Requests where GitHub Copilot performs automated implementations and executes appropriate notifications and actions at the right time.
It efficiently monitors PRs using the GraphQL API, targeting repositories owned by authenticated GitHub users.

## Features

- **Automated Monitoring of All Repositories**: Automatically monitors PRs in repositories owned by authenticated GitHub users.
- **Leverages GraphQL API**: Achieves high-speed monitoring through efficient data retrieval.
- **Phase Detection**: Automatically determines the PR's status (phase1: Draft state, phase2: Addressing review comments, phase3: Awaiting review, LLM working: Coding agent in progress).
- **Dry-run Mode**: By default, only monitoring is performed, and actual actions (comment posting, making PR Ready, sending notifications) are not executed. It can be safely operated by explicit enablement.
- **Automated Comment Posting**: Automatically posts appropriate comments according to the phase (requires enablement in the configuration file).
- **Multi-Agent Support**: Automatically mentions `@codex[agent]` if the PR author is an `*-codex-coding-agent` type (e.g., `openai-code-agent`), `@claude[agent]` if an `*-claude-coding-agent` type (e.g., `anthropic-code-agent`), and falls back to `@copilot` if neither applies (can be overridden with `[coding_agent].agent_name`, defaults to @copilot if not set).
- **Automated Draft PR Readying**: Automatically changes Draft PRs to a Ready state for addressing review comments in phase2 (requires enablement in the configuration file).
- **Mobile Notifications**: Uses ntfy.sh to send notifications to mobile devices when phase3 (awaiting review) is detected (requires enablement in the configuration file).
  - Notifies when individual PRs enter phase3.
  - Also notifies when all PRs enter phase3 (message configurable in TOML).
- **Issue List Display**: If all PRs are in "LLM working" and there are no open PRs in a repository, displays the top N issues (default: 10, configurable with `issue_display_limit`).
- **Power-Saving Mode**: If no state changes occur, the monitoring interval is automatically extended to reduce API usage (configurable with `no_change_timeout` and `reduced_frequency_interval`).
- **Verbose Mode**: Displays detailed configuration information on startup and during execution to assist in detecting configuration errors (enabled with `verbose`).

## Architecture

This tool is a Python application modularized according to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

```

### Phase Detection Logic

The tool identifies the following four phases:

1. **phase1 (Draft State)**: When the PR is in a Draft state and there is a review request.
2. **phase2 (Addressing Review Comments)**: When `copilot-pull-request-reviewer` has posted review comments, and corrections are required.
3. **phase3 (Awaiting Review)**: When `copilot-swe-agent` has completed corrections and is awaiting human review.
4. **LLM working (Coding Agent in Progress)**: When none of the above apply (e.g., Copilot is implementing).

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher is installed.
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) is installed and authenticated.
  ```bash
  gh auth login
  ```

### Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cat2151/cat-github-watcher.git
   cd cat-github-watcher
   ```

2. Create a configuration file (optional):
   ```bash
   cp config.toml.example config.toml
   ```

3. Edit `config.toml` to configure monitoring intervals, execution modes, ntfy.sh notifications, Copilot auto-assignment, and auto-merging (optional):
   ```toml
   # Check interval (e.g., "30s", "1m", "5m", "1h", "1d")
   interval = "1m"
   
   # Maximum number of issues to display from repositories without open PRs
   # Default is 10, but can be changed to any positive number (e.g., 5, 15, 20)
   issue_display_limit = 10
   
   # Timeout duration for no state change
   # If the state of all PRs (phase of each PR) does not change for this duration,
   # the monitoring interval switches to power-saving mode (reduced_frequency_interval below).
   # Setting an empty string "" disables it.
   # Supported formats: "30s", "1m", "5m", "30m", "1h", "1d"
   # Default: "30m" (30 minutes - stability priority)
   no_change_timeout = "30m"
   
   # Override the coding agent mention used in posted comments (defaults to @copilot if omitted)
   [coding_agent]
   agent_name = "@codex[agent]"
   
   # Monitoring interval in power-saving mode
   # If no state change is detected during the no_change_timeout period,
   # the monitoring interval switches to this interval to reduce API usage.
   # When a change is detected, it returns to the regular monitoring interval.
   # Supported formats: "30s", "1m", "5m", "30m", "1h", "1d"
   # Default: "1h" (1 hour)
   reduced_frequency_interval = "1h"
   
   # Verbose Mode - Displays detailed configuration information
   # If enabled, all settings are displayed on startup, and repository-specific settings are shown during execution.
   # Helps detect configuration errors.
   # Default: false
   verbose = false
   
   # Color scheme for terminal output
   # Can be 'monokai' (default) or 'classic'
   color_scheme = "monokai"
   
   # Toggle display of PR author
   # Controls whether "Author: <login>" is displayed in CLI output
   # Default: false
   display_pr_author = false
   
   # Execution control flags - only configurable within the [[rulesets]] section
   # Global flags are no longer supported
   # To apply settings to all repositories, use 'repositories = ["all"]'
   
   # Ruleset configuration example:
   # [[rulesets]]
   # name = "Default for all repositories - dry-run mode"
   # repositories = ["all"]  # "all" matches all repositories
   # enable_execution_phase1_to_phase2 = false  # Set to true to ready draft PRs
   # enable_execution_phase2_to_phase3 = false  # Set to true to post phase2 comments
   # enable_execution_phase3_send_ntfy = false  # Set to true to send ntfy notifications
   # enable_execution_phase3_to_merge = false   # Set to true to merge phase3 PRs
   
   # [[rulesets]]
   # name = "Simple: Auto-assign good first issues to Copilot"
   # repositories = ["my-repo"]
   # assign_good_first_old = true  # This is enough! The [assign_to_copilot] section is not needed.
   #                               # Default behavior: Open issue in browser for manual assignment.
   
   # ntfy.sh notification settings (optional)
   # Notifications include clickable action buttons to open the PR.
   [ntfy]
   enabled = false  # Set to true to enable notifications
   topic = "<Enter your ntfy.sh topic name here>"  # Anyone can read/write, so use a non-guessable string.
   message = "PR is ready for review: {url}"  # Message template
   priority = 4  # Notification priority (1=lowest, 3=default, 4=high, 5=highest)
   all_phase3_message = "All PRs are now in phase3 (ready for review)"  # Message when all PRs are in phase3
   
   # Phase3 Auto-Merge Settings (Optional)
   # Automatically merges PRs once they reach phase3 (awaiting review).
   # Before merging, the comment defined below will be posted to the PR.
   # After successful merge, the feature branch will be automatically deleted.
   # IMPORTANT: For safety, this feature is disabled by default.
   # You must explicitly enable it by setting enable_execution_phase3_to_merge = true in rulesets for each repository.
   # IMPORTANT: If auto-merge is enabled, the comment field must be explicitly set.
   [phase3_merge]
   comment = "The agent determines that review comments have been addressed. Under the user's responsibility, user review is omitted. Merging the PR."  # Comment to post before merging (required when auto-merge is enabled)
   automated = false  # Set to true to click the merge button via browser automation.
   wait_seconds = 10  # Wait time in seconds before clicking the button after browser launch.
   debug_dir = "debug_screenshots"  # Directory to save debug info on image recognition failure (default: "debug_screenshots")
   
   # Auto-assign issues to Copilot (completely optional! This entire section is optional)
   # 
   # Simple usage: just set assign_good_first_old = true in rulesets (see example above).
   # Only define this section if you want to customize the default behavior.
   # 
   # Assignment behavior is controlled by ruleset flags:
   # - assign_ci_failure_old: Assigns the oldest "ci-failure" issue (by issue number, default: false).
   # - assign_deploy_pages_failure_old: Assigns the oldest "deploy-pages-failure" issue (by issue number, default: false).
   # - assign_good_first_old: Assigns the oldest "good first issue" issue (by issue number, default: false).
   # - assign_old: Assigns the oldest issue (by issue number, any label, default: false).
   # Priority: ci-failure > deploy-pages-failure > good first issue > old issue
   # 
   # Default behavior (if this section is not defined):
   # - Automatically clicks buttons via browser automation.
   # - Uses PyAutoGUI for image recognition.
   # - OCR fallback (optional) if image recognition fails.
   # - wait_seconds = 10
   # 
   # Required: PyAutoGUI installation needed (pip install pyautogui pillow)
   # Optional: pytesseract installation needed for OCR fallback.
   # 
   # IMPORTANT: For safety, this feature is disabled by default.
   # You must explicitly enable it by specifying assign_ci_failure_old / assign_deploy_pages_failure_old /
   # assign_good_first_old / assign_old in rulesets for each repository.
   [assign_to_copilot]
   wait_seconds = 10  # Wait time in seconds before clicking the button after browser launch.
   debug_dir = "debug_screenshots"  # Directory to save debug info on image recognition failure (default: "debug_screenshots")
   confidence = 0.8  # Image matching confidence 0.0-1.0 (default: 0.8)
   enable_ocr_detection = true  # Enable OCR fallback (default: true)
   # enable_html_detection = false  # HTML detection fallback (experimental, default: false)
   ```

4. **Prepare Button Screenshots (only if using automation)**:
   
   If you are using automation features (`automated = true` or enabling `assign_to_copilot` / `phase3_merge`),
   screenshots of the buttons that PyAutoGUI should click are required.
   
   **Required Screenshots:**
   
   For automated issue assignment (`assign_to_copilot` feature):
   - `assign_to_copilot.png` - Screenshot of the "Assign to Copilot" button.
   - `assign.png` - Screenshot of the "Assign" button.
   
   For automated PR merging (if `automated = true` in `phase3_merge` feature):
   - `merge_pull_request.png` - Screenshot of the "Merge pull request" button.
   - `confirm_merge.png` - Screenshot of the "Confirm merge" button.
   - `delete_branch.png` - Screenshot of the "Delete branch" button (optional).
   
   **How to Take Screenshots:**
   
   a. Open a GitHub issue or PR in your browser.
   b. Locate the button you want to automate.
   c. Take a screenshot of **only the button** (not the entire screen).
   d. Save it as a PNG file in the `screenshots` directory.
   e. Use the exact filenames specified above.
   
   **Tips:**
   - The screenshot should include only the button, with a small margin.
   - Use your OS's screenshot tool (Windows: Snipping Tool, Mac: Cmd+Shift+4).
   - Ensure the button is clearly visible and not obscured.
   - If the button's appearance changes (e.g., due to theme changes), you will need to update the screenshots.
   - Use the `confidence` setting to adjust image recognition reliability (due to DPI scaling or themes).
   
   **Automatic Saving of Debug Information:**
   - If image recognition fails, debug information is automatically saved.
   - Location: `debug_screenshots/` directory (default).
   - Contents saved:
     - Screenshot (entire screen at time of failure): `{button_name}_fail_{timestamp}.png`
     - Candidate region screenshots (if found): `{button_name}_candidate_{timestamp}_{number}.png`
     - Failure information JSON: `{button_name}_fail_{timestamp}.json`
       - Button name, timestamp, confidence threshold, screenshot path, template image path.
       - Candidate region information (coordinates, size, confidence).
   - During debugging, up to 3 candidate regions are detected with lower confidence (0.7, 0.6, 0.5).
   - The debug directory can be changed in settings: `debug_dir` option (within the `assign_to_copilot` or `phase3_merge` sections).
   
   **Fallback Methods (if image recognition fails):**
   - **OCR Detection (default enabled)**: Uses pytesseract to detect button text.
     - Directly detects text like "Assign to Copilot" on the screen.
     - Robust against sub-pixel rendering differences.
     - Required: tesseract-ocr installation (system-level).
     - Disable: `enable_ocr_detection = false`
   
   **Important Requirements:**
   - You must already be **logged in to GitHub** in your default browser.
   - Automation uses an existing browser session (it does not perform new authentication).
   - Ensure the correct GitHub window/tab is focused and visible on screen when clicking buttons.
   - If multiple GitHub pages are open, the first button found will be clicked.
   
   **Create Screenshots Directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir screenshots
   ```

5. Install PyAutoGUI (only if using automation):
   
   For basic image recognition only:
   ```bash
   pip install pyautogui pillow pygetwindow
   ```
   
   Including OCR fallback (recommended):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-automation.txt
   ```
   
   If using OCR, install tesseract-ocr on your system:
   - **Windows**: `choco install tesseract`
   - **macOS**: `brew install tesseract`
   - **Linux**: `apt-get install tesseract-ocr`

### Execution

Start the tool to begin monitoring:

```bash
python3 cat-github-watcher.py [config.toml]
```

Or, run directly as a Python module:

```bash
python3 -m src.gh_pr_phase_monitor.main [config.toml]
```

### Workflow

1. **Startup**: When the tool starts, it begins monitoring repositories owned by the authenticated GitHub user.
2. **PR Detection**: Automatically detects repositories with open PRs.
3. **Phase Determination**: Determines the phase of each PR (phase1/2/3, LLM working).
4. **Action Execution**:
   - **phase1**: Default is Dry-run (if `enable_execution_phase1_to_phase2 = true` in rulesets, changes Draft PR to Ready state).
   - **phase2**: Default is Dry-run (if `enable_execution_phase2_to_phase3 = true` in rulesets, posts a comment requesting Copilot to apply changes).
   - **phase3**: Opens the PR page in the browser.
     - If `enable_execution_phase3_send_ntfy = true` in rulesets, also sends ntfy.sh notification.
     - If `enable_execution_phase3_to_merge = true` in rulesets, automatically merges the PR (using global `[phase3_merge]` settings).
   - **LLM working**: Waits (if all PRs are in this state, displays issues from repositories without open PRs).
5. **Automated Issue Assignment**: If all PRs are in "LLM working" and there are repositories without open PRs:
   - If `assign_ci_failure_old = true` in rulesets, automatically assigns the oldest "ci-failure" issue (by issue number).
   - If `assign_deploy_pages_failure_old = true` in rulesets, automatically assigns the oldest "deploy-pages-failure" issue (by issue number).
   - If `assign_good_first_old = true` in rulesets, automatically assigns the oldest "good first issue" issue (by issue number).
   - If `assign_old = true` in rulesets, automatically assigns the oldest issue (by issue number, any label).
   - Priority: ci-failure > deploy-pages-failure > good first issue > old issue
   - Default behavior: Automatically clicks buttons with PyAutoGUI (the `[assign_to_copilot]` section is not needed).
   - Required: PyAutoGUI installation and preparation of button screenshots are necessary.
6. **Repetition**: Continues monitoring at the configured interval.
   - If no state changes occur for the duration set by `no_change_timeout`, it automatically switches to power-saving mode (`reduced_frequency_interval`) to reduce API usage.
   - When a change is detected, it returns to the regular monitoring interval.

### Dry-run Mode

By default, the tool operates in **Dry-run Mode** and does not execute actual actions. This allows you to safely verify its operation.

- **Phase1 (Draft → Ready)**: Displays `[DRY-RUN] Would mark PR as ready for review` but performs no action.
- **Phase2 (Comment Posting)**: Displays `[DRY-RUN] Would post comment for phase2` but performs no action.
- **Phase3 (ntfy Notification)**: Displays `[DRY-RUN] Would send ntfy notification` but performs no action.
- **Phase3 (Merge)**: Displays `[DRY-RUN] Would merge PR` but performs no action.

To enable actual actions, set the following flags to `true` in the `[[rulesets]]` section of `config.toml`:
```toml
[[rulesets]]
name = "Enable automation for a specific repository"
repositories = ["test-repo"]  # Or ["all"] for all repositories
enable_execution_phase1_to_phase2 = true  # Ready Draft PRs
enable_execution_phase2_to_phase3 = true  # Post Phase2 comments
enable_execution_phase3_send_ntfy = true  # Send ntfy notifications
enable_execution_phase3_to_merge = true   # Merge Phase3 PRs
assign_ci_failure_old = true              # Auto-assign ci-failure issues
assign_deploy_pages_failure_old = true    # Auto-assign deploy-pages-failure issues
assign_good_first_old = true              # Auto-assign good first issues
```

### Stopping

You can stop monitoring with `Ctrl+C`.

## Notes

- GitHub CLI (`gh`) must be installed and authenticated.
- Assumes integration with GitHub Copilot (specifically `copilot-pull-request-reviewer` and `copilot-swe-agent`).
- Only **user-owned repositories** of the authenticated user are monitored. Organization repositories are not included to keep the tool simple and focused (YAGNI principle).
- Since the GraphQL API is used, be mindful of API rate limits.
- If using ntfy.sh notifications, configure a topic on [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh/) beforehand.

## Testing

The project includes a test suite using pytest:
